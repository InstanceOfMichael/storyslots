# This is such a hack. 

*I am so sorry.* But it works! 

Inspired by Lecture 1 of [Brandon Sanderson's course](http://www.writeaboutdragons.com/brandon_w2012/). 

**To Do**
- Add more settings, plots, and characters to default lists.
- Allow users to brainstorm ad hoc items into the lists, or remove default items.
- Support a history of items or combinations that were liked. This would allow, for example, pulling in multiple character ideas at once.
- OMG MY EYES SOMEONE MAKE THIS PRETTY
